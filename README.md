<summary><u>üè∑Ô∏è Additional Remarks for Edge Cases :</u></summary>

>* While choosing top 2 categories if there is a tie between 2nd topmost and its next category choose the category which comes first in alphabetical order.
>* Similarly , for movie recommendation , in case of tie between top 3 and next movie ,  choose the movie which come first in alphabetical order.
>* Again, for most featured actor, if there is ties between two actor, choose the actor whose name comes first in alphabetical order. 
>* If for a customer , top 3 recommendations are not available ( either for actor movie recommendation or for movie-recommendation in top 2 categories ) marketing team is happy with at least 1 movie. 
>* But in case if that is also not available then mark the customer as red-flag . make sure you flag for all 3 different types of movie-recommendations ( movie, top category, second top category) seperatly in different different column.
